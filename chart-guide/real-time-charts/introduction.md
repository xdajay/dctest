Real-time charts, also known as data streaming charts, are charts that automatically update themselves after every *n* seconds, without any page refreshes, by getting new data from the server.

FusionCharts Suite XT currently offers the following six real-time charts:

* Real-time Area

* Real-time Column

* Real-time Line

* Real-time Stacked Area

* Real-time Stacked Column

* Real-time Line (Dual Y)

Charts used in live stock monitoring are real-time charts. These charts first present the historical data for a given period of time. When new data is available, the charts update automatically and display the new data after discarding the previous value.

A real-time line chart used for stock price monitoring at Harryâ€™s SuperMart looks like this:
