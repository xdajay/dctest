## Basics of Drag-able Charts

Drag-able charts allow you to visually morph the data to update the figures on the chart. These charts derive their basic features from the multi-series column, the multi-series line, and the multi-series area charts.

FusionCharts Suite XT offers the following three types of drag-able charts:

* <a href="/chart-guide/drag-able-charts/introduction#drag-able-column-2d" class="smoth-scroll">Drag-able column 2D chart</a>
* <a href="/chart-guide/drag-able-charts/introduction#drag-able-line-2d" class="smoth-scroll">Drag-able line 2D chart</a>
* <a href="/chart-guide/drag-able-charts/introduction#drag-able-area-2d" class="smoth-scroll">Drag-able area 2D chart</a>

Once you are done with the visual updating of data, you can submit the data:

1. Either back to the server as form data(like HTML Forms)

2. Or, to JavaScript functions present on the same page as the chart. These JavaScript functions can then process the data and do the needful.

## Types of Drag-able Charts
