FusionCharts Suite XT allows you to plot two types of logarithmic charts - log column charts and log line charts.

In this section, you will be shown how you can:

* <a href="/chart-guide/logarithmic-charts/creating-logarithmic-charts#creating-the-log-column-2d-chart" class="smoth-scroll">Create the log column 2D chart</a>

* <a href="/chart-guide/logarithmic-charts/creating-logarithmic-charts#creating-the-log-line-2d-chart" class="smoth-scroll">Create the log line 2D chart</a>

## Creating the Log Column 2D Chart

As an example, we will create a log column 2D chart that compares the store footfalls with the online visits for one year.

The log column chart thus rendered looks like this:

{% embed_all chart-guide-logarithmic-charts-creating-logarithmic-charts-example-1.js %}


## Creating the Log Line 2D Chart

As an example, we will create a log line 2D chart that compares the store footfalls with the online visits for one year.

The log line chart thus rendered looks like this:

{% embed_all {"source": "chart-guide-logarithmic-charts-creating-logarithmic-charts-example-2.js", "id": "2"} %}
