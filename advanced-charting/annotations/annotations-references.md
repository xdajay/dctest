This article covers the exhaustive set of attributes and macros supported by annotations in FusionCharts Suite XT.

## General Configuration Attributes

The root `annotations` object accepts a number of attributes for configuring generic aspects of annotations globally.

These attributes are defined using the code structure shown below:

```javascript
{
    "annotations": {
        // Define the general configuration attributes here.
    }
}
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`autoScale`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether the annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` disables the automatic scaling of the group, setting it to `1` (default) enables it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`constrainedScale`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether annotations will retain their aspect ratio (the height:width ratio) when scaled. Setting this attribute to `0` will disable constrained scaling, setting it to `1` (default) will enable it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`scaleText`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether text annotations in an annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` (default) disables the automatic scaling of text annotations, setting it to `1` enables it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`scaleImages`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether image annotations in an annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` (default) disables the automatic scaling of image annotations, setting it to `1` enables it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`xShift`</td>
    <td>The value of this attribute is added to the x coordinate position value of the final annotation items on the x-axis. In other words, if an annotation is placed at 100 pixels left and the value of `xShift` is set to 50, then the effective value of the x coordinate for the annotation adds up to 150 pixels. When applying scaling, the value of this attribute is included within the scale factor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`yShift`</td>
    <td>Like the `xShift` attribute, this attribute applies to the y-axis.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`grpXShift`</td>
    <td>Shifts all annotation groups along the x coordinate. The difference between `xShift` and this attribute is that, during scaling, `xShift` is included within the scale factor whereas `grpXShift` is excluded.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`grpYShift`</td>
    <td>Like the `grpXShift` attribute, this attribute applies to the y-axis.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`origW`</td>
    <td>Specifies the original width of the chart, in which the annotation renders as intended. It is used as the reference width while automatically scaling annotations, in the event that a chart is resized.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`origH`</td>
    <td>Specifies the original height of chart, in which the annotation renders as intended. It is used as the reference height while automatically scaling annotations, in the event that a chart is resized.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Configuration Attributes for Annotation Groups

Annotation groups accept a number of attributes to uniformly configure all annotation items contained within them. Default values for group attributes are inherited from the ones defined as root-level annotation attributes.

These attributes are defined using the code structure shown below:

```javascript
{
    "annotations": {
        "groups": [{
            //Define the group configuration attributes here.
        }]
    }
}
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>Specifies a unique identification string for the annotation group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`x`</td>
    <td>Specifies the x coordinate of the starting position of the group with respect to the leftmost position (taken as 0) of the chart. If it is also configured individually for the annotation item(s) within the group, then the value of the `x` attribute for the item is set relative to the value of the `x` attribute for the group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`y`</td>
    <td>Specifies the y coordinate of the starting position of the group with respect to the topmost position (taken as 0) of the chart. If it is also configured individually for the annotation item(s) within the group, then the value of the `y` attribute for the item is set relative to the value of the `y` attribute for the group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`autoScale`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether the annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` disables the automatic scaling of the group, setting it to `1` (default) enables it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`scaleText`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether text annotations in an annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` (default) disables the automatic scaling of text annotations, setting it to `1` enables it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`scaleImages`</td>
    <td>Specifies whether image annotations in an annotation group will automatically scale, if chart dimensions change. Setting this attribute to `0` (default) disables the automatic scaling of image annotations, setting it to `1` enables it.</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`xShift`</td>
    <td>The value of this attribute is added to the x coordinate position value of the final annotation items on the x-axis. In other words, if an annotation is placed at 100 pixels left and the value of `xShift` is set to 50, then the effective value of the x coordinate for the annotation adds up to 150 pixels. When applying scaling, the value of this attribute is included within the scale factor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`yShift`</td>
    <td>Like the `xShift` attribute, this attribute applies to the y-axis.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`grpXShift`</td>
    <td>Shifts all annotation groups along the x coordinate. The difference between `xShift` and this attribute is that, during scaling, `xShift` is included within the scale factor whereas `grpXShift` is excluded.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`font`</td>
    <td>Specifies the font family for the text annotation(s) in the annotation group. </td>

## Configuration Attributes for Annotation Items

These attributes are defined using the code structure shown below:

```javascript
{
    "annotations": {
        "groups": [{
            "items": [{
                //Define the annotation items configuration attributes here.
            }]
        }]
    }
}
```

For simplicity, the annotation items configuration attributes are segregated into:

* Common attributes (that work for all annotation types)

* Ad hoc attributes (that work for only certain annotation types)

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`fillRatio`</td>
    <td>Specifies the ratio for distribution for all colors specified as a comma-separated list to the `fillColor` attribute. This attribute takes values between 0 and 100. The number of values provided for this attribute should be the same as that for the `fillColor` attribute.

### Sub-token Macros for Positioning with Respect to the Dataset and Axes

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Macro Name</th>
    <th>Sub Tokens Applicable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$dataset</td>
    <td>dataset_index [separator] set [separator] set_index [separator] position_key</td>
    <td>Lets you add the position information of the plots in a dataset to the annotation.</td>
    <td>Possible position_key values are X, Y, STARTX, STARTY, ENDX, ENDY, CENTERX, CENTERY.

For example, to position a rectangle above the second column in a column chart, the possible values could be:
x: $dataset.0.set.1.STARTX,
y:$dataset.0.set.1.STARTY,
tox: $dataset.0.set.1.STARTX+100,
toy:$dataset.0.set.1.STARTY-40 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$yaxis</td>
    <td>yaxis_index [separator] label [separator] label_index [separator] position_key</td>
    <td>Lets you add the position information of the y-axis labels to the annotation.</td>
    <td>Possible position_key values are X, Y, STARTX, STARTY, ENDX, ENDY, CENTERX, CENTERY.

For example, to position a text on the y axis, the possible values could be:
x: $yaxis.0.label.1.startx -12,
y: $yaxis.0.label.0.starty - 5
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$xaxis</td>
    <td>xaxis_index [separator] label [separator] label_index [separator] position_key</td>
    <td>Lets you add the position information of the x-axis labels to the annotation.</td>
    <td>Possible position_key values for this macro are the same as that for the `$yaxis` macro.

For example, to position a text on the x axis, the possible values could be:
x: $xaxis.label.1.startx+2,
y: $xaxis.label.0.starty+3
</td>
