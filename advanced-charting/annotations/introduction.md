FusionCharts Suite XT offers a wide range of [charts, gauges, and maps](http://www.fusioncharts.com/charts/) that you can use to graphically present data. In addition to plotting static data, the conventional chart types can also be used to plot real-time data.

The product supports **annotations**, a powerful feature that enables you to increase the visual appeal of your charts as well as make them more informative.

For a glimpse of how this feature works, look at the example shown below.

Assume that Harry wants to compare sales of the top four chocolate brands at his SuperMart.

A conventional column 2D chart used to show this data will look like this:

{% embed_chart advanced-charting-annotations-introduction-example-1.js %}

Now, see how this chart looks when rendered using annotations:

{% embed_chart advanced-charting-annotations-introduction-example-2.js %}

Looks much better, doesnâ€™t it? The chocolate bars shown in this chart are image annotations.

The FusionCharts Suite XT annotations, like the name suggests, let you add descriptive information to your charts. You can customize your charts using different shapes, images, and custom notes.

Take a look at this video of a [collaboration dashboard](http://www.fusioncharts.com/dashboards/collaboration/) created to help a sales team unify their analysis and discussion. Notice the **callouts** shown above the columns for April and August. These callouts are shape annotations and the **numbers** shown next to the callouts are text annotations. Click these callouts and see how the annotations work!

In addition to creating annotations, FusionCharts Suite XT lets you:

* Customize annotations for their functional properties as well as their look and feel

* Position them on your chart or gauge using absolute or relative values

* Create and control them dynamically

* Customize the response to user actions using annotation events

Now that you have seen what annotations look like and how useful they can be in making your charts informative, go ahead and see how you can create them.
