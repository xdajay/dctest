To setup a private export server in Java, you will need the __official J2EE export handler__ provided in the FusionCharts package. The export handler will provide the necessary files to configure the export server. It will handle all exporting requests sent by the user and generate the chart in the requested format. The J2EE export handler is dependent on two external modules—__Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__—for conversion. These modules need to be downloaded and installed separately on the same server.

<p class="text-info"> Starting FusionCharts Suite XT v3.11.0, __Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__ are no longer required for browsers with canvas support. </p>

## How does it work?

__Step 1__: A chart is rendered in the browser.

__Step 2__: When an export option is selected, the chart generates the SVG string that represents the current state and sends it to the export server.

__Step 3__: The export server captures the SVG string.

__Step 4__: The export server invokes a system call, triggering __Inkscape__ to convert the  FusionCharts generated SVG string (which is passed to the server-side script over AJAX) to __PDF__, __PNG__, and __SVG__. However, __Inkscape__ still has a limitation of generating a JPG file. Hence, __ImageMagick__ is used to create the __JPG__ files.
To export chart data as __XLS__, the CSV data generated from the charts is converted to the XLS format.

<p class="text-info"> Starting FusionCharts Suite XT v3.11.0, images are processed on client-side for modern browsers (with canvas support). This eliminates the use of third party software like __Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__ for server-side as well as client-side exporting. </p>

__Step 5__: The export handler either writes the exported chart/chart data to disk, based on the configuration provided by the chart, or streams it back to the user as a download.

<p class="text-info"> Starting v3.11.0, FusionCharts supports exporting chart data as __XLS__. To export chart data in the XLS format, using server-side exporting, it is mandatory that the exporting server has the latest code, which is available in the FusionCharts package. Alternatively the FusionCharts export link, __export.api3.fusioncharts.com__, can also be used.  </p>

## Installation

__Step 1__: Setup a Windows/Linux based server with __administrative__ access to install the export handler. This is particularly important if you are using a shared hosting service for your web server.

__Step 2__: Install __Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__ as both these modules are necessary dependencies for the J2EE export handler to work.

<p class="text-info"> Starting FusionCharts Suite XT v3.11.0, __Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__ are no longer required for browsers with canvas support. </p>

__Step 3__: Copy files from the FusionCharts J2EE Export Handler to the server.

__Step 4__:  Add the following servlet mapping in your application's __web.xml__:<br/>
```html
<servlet>
    <display-name>FCExporter</display-name>
    <servlet-name>FCExporter</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.fusioncharts.exporter.servlet.FCExporter</servlet-class>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>FCExporter</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/JSP/ExportExample/FCExporter</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

__Step 5__: Modify the `url-pattern` as per your application needs.

__Step 6__: Set the path to the folder where the generated image is to be saved on the server, in the __fusioncharts_export.properties__ file, inside the __Classes__ directory.

__Step 7__: Set the configuration for the __Inkscape__ and __ImageMagick__ path, __only for the Windows Environment__.
Open the __fusioncharts_export.properties__ file present in the __Classes__ directory and make the following changes: <br/>

```javascript
# Please specify the path to a folder with write permissions
# The exported image/PDF files would be saved here (for Linux based server SAVEPATH should be changed to relative or absolute path accordingly)
SAVEPATH = /JSP/ExportExample/ExportedImages/

# This constant HTTP_URI stores the HTTP reference to
# the folder where exported charts will be saved.
# Please enter the HTTP representation of that folder
# in this constant e.g., http://www.yourdomain.com/images/
HTTP_URI = http://localhost:8081/ExportHandler/JSP/ExportExample/ExportedImages/

# OVERWRITEFILE sets whether the export handler would overwrite an existing file
# the newly created exported file. If it is set to false the export handler would
# not overwrite. In this case if INTELLIGENTFILENAMING is set to true the handler
# would add a suffix to the new file name. The suffix is a randomly generated UUID.
# Additionally, you can add a timestamp or random number as additional prefix.
FILESUFFIXFORMAT = TIMESTAMP
OVERWRITEFILE = false
INTELLIGENTFILENAMING = true

# Set the path of Inkscape here(Only for Windows)
INKSCAPE_PATH = C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Inkscape

# Set the path of ImageMagick here(Only for Windows)
IMAGEMAGICK_PATH = C:\\Program Files\\ImageMagick-6.9.0-Q16
```

## Inkscape

Inkscape is an open source vector graphics editor. What sets Inkscape apart is its use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an open XML-based W3C standard, as the native format. Inkscape has a powerful command line interface and can be used in scripts for a variety of tasks, such as exporting and format conversions.

## ImageMagick

ImageMagick is a free and open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files. The software mainly consists of a number of command-line interface utilities for manipulating images.

## Configuring the export server

To use the private export server, the following attributes need to be configured correctly in the chart.

<table width="95%" border="0" class="table" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <th width="25%" valign="top" class="header">Attribute Name</th>
            <th width="75%" valign="top" class="header">Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top" class="code">`exportEnabled`</td>
            <td valign="top" class="text">Set to __1__ to enable exporting the chart.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top" class="code">`exportAtClient`</td>
            <td valign="top" class="text">Set to __0__ to enable export via a Private Export Server.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top" class="code">`exportHandler`</td>
            <td valign="top" class="text">Set to the absolute path of the export handler, for example: __http://www.example.com/fcExportHandler/FCExporter__</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td valign="top" class="code">`exportAction`</td>
            <td valign="top" class="text">Set to __save__ to store the exported file on the private export server itself. Set to __download__ to send the file back to the user (client) for download.</td>
        </tr>
