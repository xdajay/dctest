## Installing Maps as part of FusionCharts Suite XT

Maps are installed as a part of FusionCharts Suite XT package. For detailed instructions on installing FusionCharts Suite XT or FusionMaps XT, see (/getting-started/installation).

Once installed, ensure that `fusioncharts.js` and `fusioncharts.maps.js` files are present in the `fusioncharts` folder. You will also need to paste the relevant map definition files in the `fusioncharts/maps/` folder for any specific maps you want to use.

## Installing Additional Map Files

The FusionCharts Suite XT download package contains only the USA and World maps as a part of the package. To work with other maps, you will require the map definition files for those maps. A map definition file contains all the data required to create and render a map. You can download the additional map definition files from [here](http://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition).  

The map definition files thus downloaded are extremely high resolution maps. If your application is not required to render the full resolution maps, you can send in a [request for custom resolution maps](http://www.fusioncharts.com/download/maps/definition/) to our Customer Support team. 

Once youâ€™ve downloaded the map definition package, locate the maps folder in the package. Copy the relevant map definition files from the maps folder of the download package to the `fusioncharts/maps` folder to start using those maps. For example, if you are interested in the California map, copy the `fusioncharts.california.js` file from the maps folder of the download package and paste it in the `fusioncharts/maps/` folder.
